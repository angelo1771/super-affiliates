Does Wealthy Affiliate Work?

Upon signing up, the resources that i was given access to was really quite overwhelming. The site is literally a gold mine for any Internet marketer. You gain immediate access to keyword list, video tutorials, case studies and an excellent private forum that's full of successful marketers who openly help you with any problems that you may have. The Wealthy affiliate members are the best collection of Internet marketers that i have ever come across. My favorite part of wealthy affiliate is without doubt the one on one coaching that Kyle and Carson make available to their members. This alone is worthy of the $29 p/m fee. There are so called gurus out there that charge an absolute fortune for this kind of personal tuition.

So Bottom Line, Do You Recommend Wealthy Affiliate?

I challenge you to find a better site of its type, than Wealthy Affiliate! No, actually i don't, because if you do go out there and attempt to find something better, you will waste an awful lot of time and money and I don't want to be held responsible for it!

Seriously though, if you are in need of genuine expert help with your Internet marketing, or maybe you're new on the scene, then there is not a better place on planet earth to be than Wealthy Affiliate. You owe it to your self to check it out!
