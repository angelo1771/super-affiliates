Do you prefer to make money through the Internet simply you do not have sufficient experience or working capital to begin your own online business?  You don't need cause to concern, as a lot of internet marketing alternatives exist for you to start out with.  Among one these choices, and shall I say the most beneficial, is affiliate marketing.

Affiliate marketing allows for the first time internet marketers like you the opportunity to market something online even without owning your own merchandise to sell.  All you've to do is to sign on with an affiliate marketing program, which is generally owned by an online merchant or retailer, and begin picking the merchandises you prefer to promote.  As an affiliate, you're paid from the merchant for your services on an commission base, that's if you have targeted a visitor to the merchant's web site and the visitor really purchases something.

Getting an affiliate in an affiliate marketing program is oftentimes fast and easy, and since most affiliate programs, signing up costs also free.  But in spite of these and all the profits being assured by affiliate programs, numerous people are all the same uncertain to enter affiliate marketing.  Among the reasons why numerous people continue hesitating is the lack of a website to start out marketing his affiliate products with.  This at present leads us to the question of whether a website is expected or essential in affiliate marketing or not.

Many people say that one could do affiliate marketing even without a website to start with.  Actually, one can really start promoting and marketing his affiliate products even without a website; and there exist numerous ways on how this can be done.  In truth, many affiliate marketing strategies that leads to success can exist without actually needing a website.  Among these strategies are email marketing, offline promotions, writing e-books, writing ezines and engaging in online discussions like forums, chats, message boards and others.

*Email Marketing

Email marketing, or keeping up email lists, is in reality the most popular affiliate marketing scheme that does not involve the affiliate to keep up a website.  In this affiliate marketing strategy, what you essentially do is uphold a list of the email ads of your potential purchasers and offer them with content that are relevant with the affiliate merchandises and programs you're promoting.  Content that you offer your contacts with not all of the time be promotional, since several individuals feel such types of email annoying.  Instead, it would be better if you supply them with something educational and just supply little text advertisements that link to your merchandiser site.

*Offline Promotion

There are several methods on how you'll be able to promote your affiliate products offline.  One of the most common medium practised for such promotions is classified ads, leaflets and flyers.  Classified ads would broadly speaking work finer likened to the other two since classified ads successful periodicals oftentimes get a broader audience.

*Writing Free e-books

Whenever you experience a knack in writing, authorship an e-book could be the better method for you to advance your affiliate products in the absence of an actual website.  Precisely like in emails and ezines, your readers would better value your e-book whenever it's not overly promotional merely rather informative.  Make certain, however, to create the contents of your e-books comparative to the actual affiliate products you are promoting.  And just like in email marketing, you will be able to just place text ads or banners somewhere near the end of your e-book that links to the merchant's site. 

*Writing Free Ezines

Ezines are publications or articles that aim to inform individuals about a particular topic.  If you don't have a website and yet want to be an affiliate, you can well use ezines to promote your affiliate products or to insert links to your merchant's site.  If you have a website, your ezine article may actually work well as content for your site.  But since you have no website, you can just submit your free ezine articles to various websites that hosts ezines, like goarticles.com, ezinearticles.com and others.

*Online discussions (Forums, Chats, Message Boards, etc.)

With or without a website, you just can't ignore online discussions because they are great venues for marketing your affiliate products.  In chats, forums, message boards and discussion boards with topics related to your products, you can easily find people who may be interested with the products you are promoting.

With all these strategies, it may appear that one really doesn't need to have a website to start marketing his affiliate products and promoting his affiliate programs.  Well, starting in an affiliate program without a website may be easy, but getting successful in affiliate marketing without a website is another thing.  While one can actually gain enormous success in affiliate marketing even without a website, it is a rare instance that "newbies" like you can reach the same levels of success.

Possessing a website isn't actually a requirement in getting in into an affiliate program, unless otherwise the program owner would expect you to have one.  Just while this is so, I'd still urge that you've for yourself have a website, if not at present, then perhaps at a future time.  Owning a website produces numerous rewards in affiliate marketing.  Because one, it allows for you a place where you are able to creatively promote not solely one of your affiliate merchandises but entirely your affiliate products.  With a website, you are able to as well promote your affiliate products to a broader market.

Once more, owning a website is not a essential in affiliate marketing.  Merely with the advantages that a website could provide, I'd sooner have one for myself and establish affiliate marketing a lot easier for me.
