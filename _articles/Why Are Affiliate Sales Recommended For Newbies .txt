How Easy Is It To Find Affiliate Programs?

There are litrerally thousands of affiliate programs available for you to choose from. They cover just about any topic you can think of and offer a variey of different payment schemes and reporting facilities.

For example, if your area of interest is "dog training", then you can do a Google search using the following search terms: "dog training affiliate programs" without the quotes. When I last did this search it returned over 4 million results. So you can see, there is no shortage of affiliate programs.

Another good tip is look for an affiliate link on any website that interests you. The easiest way to do this is to click on your browsers "view button" and select "source". This will load the content of the page into Notepad and you can then do a "find" for "affiliate" or "partner" to see exactly where their link is, if they have one.

The first thing you need to do is get some help in the form of step by step instructions and coaching videos designed specifically for newbies.
