Let’s just be honest with each other, you play the lottery to win, there’s no prize for just taking part.

Now if you agree that the only reason you play the lottery is to win, you need to think about how you can really increase your chances of success.

You are probably aware that the only practical way to increase your chances of winning any lottery is to increase the number of times you’re entered in each individual draw.

Unless you enjoy the trip down to your local store and can afford to buy 40 plus tickets for every draw, you should take advantage of the power of e-Lottery syndicates, to increase your chances.

e-Lottery syndicates allow you to multiply your purchasing and playing power, by grouping you with other players. This allows you to play more tickets per draw, without the extra cost of buying them all yourself.

e-Lottery syndicates have numerous benefits for lottery players:-

1. They allow you to play the largest tax-free lotteries around the world.

All you need is a computer, an internet connection and a credit card to play.

2. You get more free time.

Your numbers are entered automatically for every draw. No more trekking to the store, or worse, forgetting to buy your tickets!

3. You just have to bank the cash.

Computers automatically check to see if you’ve won, emailing you with the happy news, as it happens. There’s nothing like receiving an email telling you you’re a winner.

Your winnings are sent directly to your home, no more ticket checking, no more having to go and collect your winnings, or worse, panics caused by lost tickets, or forgetting to collect your winnings altogether!

If you don’t think this happens, a staggering £649.3 million pounds in prize money has gone unclaimed in the UK over the last 10 years, with the largest unclaimed prize being a shocking £2.9 million pounds.

4. You can win a single draw more than once.

e-Lottery syndicates call this the “Multi-Win” method. By buying multiple tickets they guarantee to have the bonus numbers covered, meaning you only have to match the main numbers to win a prize. The more main numbers matched the more multiple wins and prize money to share among the syndicate.

5. You can build an extra income.

Many people just use e-Lottery syndicates to increase their chances of winning prizes, before they even realize about the potential income from introducing other members.

e-Lottery syndicate’s work by having more and more members join, you can profit from this, by telling people all about the benefits they would receive from being in an e-Lottery syndicate.

For instance, by helping friends and family increase their chances of winning the lottery, you would lower your costs for playing, or even earn an extra income.

There’s never been a better time to join an e-Lottery syndicate; online gaming is one of the fastest growing sectors on the internet.

In the UK alone, 20 million people regularly play the lottery, spending £1 billion pounds annually, while worldwide spending on internet gambling (of which lotteries is a part) is projected to reach £10 billion pounds by 2010.

Start playing the smarter way today.
