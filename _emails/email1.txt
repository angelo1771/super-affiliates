Now, a super affiliate is considered to be the leading force in
the affiliate marketing business. They are normally the 20% of
the affiliates who drive 80% of the sales of a particular
product or niche. A super affiliate will successfully leverage
email marketing techniques by gathering a massive database and
reaching to as many potential customers as possible.

Finding the right product is crucial to affiliate marketers.
Many average affiliates will just pick a product to advertise
without thinking about it. A super affiliate considers the
lifetime value of the potential product and how that will
translate into a successful campaign. Being more interested in
the product and willing to do some research and educate yourself
is important in this case. Being motivated is another key trait
of the super affiliate. Having a lack of perseverance to reach
higher and further is a recipe for disaster in affiliate
marketing. 

Discipline is critical. You need to cultivate the ‘no matter
what’ style of thinking and adopt that as your mantra and
attitude. You need to be able to comply with your clients and be
honest.

Ultimately, the most important thing is having a positive
outlook. This is definitely the key to being successful. Having
a positive outlook allows you to focus your determination to
become more powerful and functional. Once you achieve this, you
increase your chances of success exponentially.
