Choose a niche where there are a lot of products created
specifically for the niche. For example, if you go through
clickbank, you will see a huge list of products that is catered
for the weight loss niche. If more vendors are creating
products, this means that it is a very profitable niche, that’s
why people are jumping the gun to get a piece of the pie.

You may verify this method of identifying a profitable niche by
ensuring that searches are also actively looking for these
products. To do this, make sure the keyword of the product names
have relatively high search volume by using Google Keyword Tool
to check. Ensure also that advertisers are bidding for the
product name keyword on Google Adwords. 

For affiliates, competition is a good thing! This is because
this is a sign that it is a profitable and hungry niche. With
that said, when are choosing a particular product to promote,
make sure there are active competitors that are selling a
similar product to the one you chose. This is because
competition normally is proportional to profits. 

When there is high demand for a product, it is natural for a lot
of vendors and even affiliates that try to promote to the same
niche. Competition is usually a good indicator that a particular
product is hot. In general, these popular products with big
competition will often carry with them huge profit margins which
will accelerate your potential as well.
